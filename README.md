# Parco React Task

This is a React app developed as part of the Parco React Task. The app displays interactive data visualizations and fund-related information.

## Features

### Pie Chart
- Displays a Pie Chart with sections representing different funds:
  - `C Fund`: #044F79
  - `G Fund`: #75787B
  - `I Fund`: #BAC8E5
  - `Y Fund`: #344767
  - `S Fund`: #262627
  - `F Fund`: #21B8FD
- Shows the fund name and its value dynamically in the center when hovering over a section.
- Highlighted sections when hovered over for better interactivity.
- Fully responsive design.

### Fund Table
- Lists all funds with their total values in a clean, structured table.
- Rows can be expanded to show more details like:
  - Risk Level
  - Example Companies
  - Description of the fund
- Multiple dropdowns can remain open simultaneously without closing automatically.
- Each fund name is styled with a fixed background color matching its Pie Chart section.

### Tabs
- Two navigation tabs at the top:
  - `TSP Holdings`
  - `Look Through Holdings`
- Styled as buttons with rounded corners for a modern look.
- Switching tabs dynamically updates the Pie Chart and Fund Table.

### Responsive Design
- Optimized to look great on all devices.

### Material UI
- Built using Material UI components for styling and layout.
- Reference: [Material UI Documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  

At this point, you're on your own.
